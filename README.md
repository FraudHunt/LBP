# Adapted Loopy Belief Propagation Algorithm (LBP)
Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) approach to formulate the problem of detecting fraudulent user accounts as a network classification task. The algorithm assigns labels to the user account nodes of the co-review graph. The
graph is modeled as a pairwise Markov Random Field.

Inputs:
g: a graph of type networkx.classes.graph.Graph. One can get to this type from 
a csv file containing all the edges of a graph with the weight by using 
nx.from_pandas_dataframe(pd.read_csv("csvfile.csv"), 'node1', 'node2', ['weight']).
See the Networkx module in python for more details.

Example of format of the csv file is:

node1 node2 weight

  a     b      5
  
  a     c      10
  
  .     .       .
  
  .     .       .

Then one can do :

datafile=pd.read_csv("csvfile.csv")

g=nx.from_pandas_dataframe(datafile, 'id1', 'id2', ['weight'])

delta: value related to the compatibility potentials. It is in [0,1]. 
Delta can be set based on domain knowledge or using ground truth data.
For instance, the optimal value for our problem turned out to be 0.7 after
an extensive numerical experimentation.


It makes use of the functions: compatibility, prods, prodd, prodnode. Details
about those function is found in the aux_lbp file. 

Outputs:

-A data frame whose dimension is the number of nodes in the network. The columns
are: id of the node, belief of being sybil or fraudster, degree, and sum of the 
weights to its neighbors.

-Number of iterations taken to converge.
